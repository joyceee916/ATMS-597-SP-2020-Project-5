This repository contains classification models for precipitation, trained and tested on ASOS data for the Green Bay Airport in Wisconsin. The models aim to differentiate between snow and rain, based on a few other weather variables. 

The Python code is split into three sections: data import and cleanup, logistic regression models, and ensemble methods/machine learning models. The models were evaluated primarily using the Briar skill score.
